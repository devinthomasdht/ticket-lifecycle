In this ticket the CEO's laptop would not turn on. The first step is to review the ticket. Read the ticket details to ensure you understand the issue described. The next step is the initial response. Acknowledge the issue by responding promptly and apologizing for any inconvenience. Clarify the problem, if needed ask for more details to confirm the issue. Check common causes, ask the CEO to press the power button on the laptop, if that doesn't work have them plug the charger into the laptop to see if it will charge. Provide a solution, in this case, the laptop charger was not working so another laptop charger will be bought or issued. Close the ticket, update the ticket after resolving the issue. Following up during this process should be a must. After resolution it is optional, in this case checking on the CEO to see if they are satisfied with the solution.

How thorough documentation is in the ticketing system is vital to resolution. The Resolution field in ticketing systems like osTicket is essential for organizations as it provides clear documentation of how issues were resolved, ensuring consistency and transparency in support. It enables knowledge sharing, helps agents deliver consistent service, and improves customer satisfaction by keeping clients informed. Detailed resolutions also support accountability, facilitate compliance with industry regulations, and allow for better reporting and performance tracking. Additionally, they help identify recurring issues and root causes, enabling long-term improvements in processes and products. In this example you can see conversations with the customer and internal notes. This is key to informing other agents and management if the problem recurs. Being thorough when documenting is vital to resolution.
